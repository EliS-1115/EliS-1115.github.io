                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I'm passionate about creating things that make a difference, whether it's designing video games that people love or building apps and devices that help others reach their fitness goals. With my major being computer science and my strong love for fitness, I'm drawn to projects that mix tech, creativity, and impact. I enjoy focused, meaningful work, such as things that require organization, problem-solving and a clear purpose. I tend to keep to myself, but the connections I do make are meaningful and lasting, which helps me in the work I do, taking my time and making sure I enjoy and succeed with my projects. More than anything, I just want to create something that lasts. Whether itâ€™s a game that wins multiple awards and that inspires many or a tool that improves the health of others. I want to know if I helped build something that has purpose. Something that I enjoy the process of whether it be the easy or the difficult parts. As long as I left things better than I found them, I will say that's all I could ask for.</p>
